### 1. Project Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a ROS 2 driver for the Unicore UM982 dual-antenna RTK GPS receiver. The driver will serve as the primary interface between the UM982 hardware and a main Linux computer running ROS 2.

The core purpose of this project is to provide reliable, high-frequency, and high-accuracy position and heading data to the ROS 2 ecosystem. The driver will be responsible for parsing a proprietary Unicore message, publishing standard ROS 2 messages for navigation, managing the device's configuration, handling the injection of RTK correction data, and reporting detailed telemetry for system health monitoring.

### 2. Core Requirements
The driver must satisfy the following high-level requirements:

| ID  | Requirement                  | Description                                                                                                                              |
| :-- | :--------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| R1  | **Data Parsing**             | The driver must parse the Unicore `PVTSLN` ASCII message received from the UM982 over a serial connection.                                  |
| R2  | **Position Output**          | The driver must publish the receiver's position (Latitude, Longitude, Altitude) and position uncertainty using a standard ROS 2 message type. |
| R3  | **Heading & IMU Output**     | The driver must publish the receiver's heading, velocity, and acceleration data using a standard ROS 2 message type.                       |
| R4  | **RTK Correction Input**     | The system must facilitate feeding RTK correction data from a specified NTRIP server to the UM982's serial port.                            |
| R5  | **Telemetry & Diagnostics**  | The driver must publish key performance indicators, such as fix quality and satellite count, using the standard ROS 2 diagnostics system.  |
| R6  | **Hardware Configuration**   | The driver must automatically configure the UM982 receiver at startup to ensure it outputs the required data stream.                       |
| R7  | **User Configurability**     | The driver must allow users to configure essential parameters, such as the serial port and baud rate, without modifying the source code. |

### 3. Core Features
The following features will be implemented to meet the core requirements:

| ID  | Feature                      | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :-- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| F1  | **NavSatFix Publisher**      | Publishes a `sensor_msgs/NavSatFix` message on the `gps/fix` topic. The message's `frame_id` will be `gps_link`. The `position_covariance` field will be populated using the standard deviation values from the `PVTSLN` message. The `position_covariance_type` will be set to `COVARIANCE_TYPE_DIAGONAL_KNOWN`. |
| F2  | **IMU Publisher**            | Publishes a `sensor_msgs/Imu` message on the `gps/imu` topic. The message's `frame_id` will be `gps_link`. The orientation quaternion will be derived from the `PVTSLN` heading, assuming zero pitch and roll. Velocity and acceleration fields will be populated directly from the `PVTSLN` message.                             |
| F3  | **Automatic GPS Configuration** | On startup, the driver will send configuration commands to the UM982 via the serial port. It will command the receiver to output the `PVTSLN` message at **20Hz** and then send the `SAVECONFIG` command to make this setting persistent across power cycles. This configuration will be sent every time the driver starts. |
| F4  | **RTK Integration via Launch** | An external `str2str` process will be used as the NTRIP client. A ROS 2 launch file will manage starting both the driver node and the `str2str` process. The launch file will be configured to **automatically restart** the `str2str` process if it terminates unexpectedly.                                                              |
| F5  | **Diagnostic Publisher**     | The driver will publish a `diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticArray` to the `/diagnostics` topic. The status will be named "RTK GPS" and will include the number of satellites. The diagnostic level will be mapped as follows: <br> - **OK:** RTK Fixed <br> - **WARN:** RTK Float, DGPS, or other unaugmented fixes <br> - **ERROR:** No Fix |
| F6  | **Parameterization**         | The driver will expose the following as ROS 2 parameters, configurable via a YAML file: <br> - `port`: The serial port path (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0`). <br> - `baudrate`: The serial connection speed (e.g., `230400`).                                                                                                                            |

### 4. Core Components
The complete system will consist of the following components:

1.  **UM982 ROS 2 Driver Node:** The primary software component, written in C++ or Python, that contains all the logic for parsing, publishing, and configuration.
2.  **`str2str` Utility:** The external command-line tool from the RTKLIB suite, responsible for handling the NTRIP connection.
3.  **Configuration File (`unicore_driver_params.yaml`):** A user-editable file to set the serial port and baud rate.
4.  **Launch File (`unicore.launch.py`):** A ROS 2 launch file that provides a single entry point for running the entire system, including the driver node and the `str2str` utility.

### 5. Application & User Flow

**A. One-Time Setup:**
1.  The user installs the ROS 2 driver package.
2.  The user installs the RTKLIB suite (`str2str` utility).
3.  The user edits the `unicore_driver_params.yaml` file to match their hardware setup (correct serial port and baud rate).

**B. System Execution:**
1.  The user connects the UM982 receiver to the Linux computer via USB.
2.  The user executes a single command: `ros2 launch unicore_driver unicore.launch.py`.

**C. Internal Process Flow:**
1.  The ROS 2 launch system starts the **`str2str` process**. It connects to `ntrip://tyleralford:ntrip@205.172.52.26:10099/GTAC_MSM4` and begins forwarding correction data to the specified serial port.
2.  The ROS 2 launch system starts the **driver node**.
3.  The driver node reads the `port` and `baudrate` parameters.
4.  The driver opens the serial port.
5.  The driver sends the configuration commands (`LOG ... ONTIME 0.05`, `SAVECONFIG`) to the UM982.
6.  The driver enters its main processing loop:
    a. It continuously reads serial data from the UM982.
    b. Upon receiving a complete `PVTSLN` message, it parses the contents.
    c. It populates and publishes the `sensor_msgs/NavSatFix` and `sensor_msgs/Imu` messages.
    d. It populates and publishes the `diagnostic_msgs/DiagnosticArray` message with the latest status.
7.  This process continues until the user shuts down the launch file.
