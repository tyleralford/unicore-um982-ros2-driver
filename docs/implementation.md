## Unicore UM982 ROS 2 Driver: Implementation Plan

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the tasks required to build, test, and deploy the Unicore UM982 ROS 2 Driver. The project will be developed in C++ using the `rclcpp` library and the `ament_cmake` build system, with Git for version control.

### Phase 0: Project Setup and Version Control

**Goal:** Establish the project's foundation with a version-controlled repository.

*   #### **Task 1: Initialize Git Repository**
    *   **Dependencies:** None
    *   **Context:** This task creates the version control structure for the project, ensuring all subsequent work is tracked.
    *   **Subtasks:**
        *   [x] Create a new remote repository (e.g., on GitHub or GitLab) named `unicore_um982_driver`.
        *   [x] Clone the empty repository to your local development machine.
        *   [x] Create a `README.md` file with an initial project title.
        *   [x] Create a `.gitignore` file tailored for ROS 2 and C++ projects. This should include common build artifacts like `build/`, `install/`, `log/`, and editor-specific files.
        *   [x] Add and commit the `README.md` and `.gitignore` files to the `main` branch.
        *   [x] Push the initial commit to the remote repository.
    *   **Intermediate Test:**
        *   [x] The remote repository should contain the `README.md` and `.gitignore` files.

    *   **Intermediate Test:**
        *   [x] Run `colcon build`. The build must complete without errors.
        *   [x] Source `install/setup.bash` and run `ros2 run unicore_um982_driver unicore_um982_driver_node`. The node should start and run without crashing.
    *   **Version Control:**

        *   [x] Create a `src/pvtsln_parser.cpp` file implementing a function `bool parsePVTSLN(const std::string& line, PVTSLNData& data)`.
        *   [x] The parser should handle comma-separated fields, validate the message format, and populate the struct.
        *   [x] Add parser source file to `CMakeLists.txt`.
        *   [x] Integrate the parser into the main node: call `parsePVTSLN()` for each received line.

    *   **Intermediate Test:**
        *   [x] Build and run the node. Verify that the console output shows structured, parsed data (e.g., "Parsed Heading: 123.45") and that the values appear correct.

        *   [x] **Populate the `NavSatFix.position_covariance` field by squaring the standard deviation values from `PVTSLNData`. Set `position_covariance_type` to `DIAGONAL_KNOWN`.**
    *   **Intermediate Test:**
        *   [x] Build and run the node.
        *   [x] Use `ros2 topic echo` on `/gps/fix` and `/gps/imu` to verify the messages are published correctly and at the expected rate.
        *   [x] **Inspect the `position_covariance` field in the `/gps/fix` topic echo to ensure the diagonal elements are non-zero and plausible.**
    *   **Version Control:**
        *   [x] Commit the publisher implementation to the `feature/publishing` branch.
